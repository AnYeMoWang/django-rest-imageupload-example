# Django REST Image Upload Example
This Django app was created for the sole purpose of teaching (and learning). If you are interested in the
steps I took to write this app, consider reading the [Tutorial](tutorial/README.md) I wrote.


## Quick Start
If you just want to see what this project does:
```
git clone https://github.com/ChristianKreuzberger/django-rest-imageupload-example.git
cd django-rest-imageupload-example
virtualenv -p python3.4 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd django_rest_imageupload_backend
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
