For a good tutorial experience I recommend that

 * you know your way around IDEs and editors (this tutorial is not about PyCharm, we only make good use of it)
 * you have a basic knowledge on how to use Linux Shell and know how to install packages on your system
 * you are comfortable using [virtual environments](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
 * you have some basic knowledge on how HTTP requests work
